# C++ Projects

1) VaR Simulation: Multivariate scenario generation using Mersenne Twister engine for normal variates and Cholesky decomposition for correlated returns for purposes of modeling portfolio VaR at various alphas and time horizons.

2) Barrier Options: Brownian Motion class implementation for simulation of underlying assets utilizing Rcpp integration for statistical functionality in R. Further implementation of analytical pricing for each class of Barrier Options.
